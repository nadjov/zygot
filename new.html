				<h3>PROBLEM(S)</h3>
				
				

				<p class="text_13">The <strong>ERP software</strong> solutions are <strong>essential</strong> need for any company, regardless of what kind of ERP. Research and practice show that with these software solutions the clients and the providers have broad range of <strong>problems and misunderstandings</strong>. When one company acquires an ERP or part of it, in predominant number of cases the implementation stage necessitates specific needs, adjustments or alterations that reflect in the ultimate product. Every time the clients feel <strong>pressured and conditioned by the provider</strong> during each of the implementation or live stages. Also, the impression persists that the solution is <strong>overly-expensive</strong> especially when modifications and alterations are needed, and they need to come from the same provider. The <strong>radical change</strong> of the software is excessively pricey and budgets have already been spent for the existing solution.</p>
			
				<span id="text"><p class="text_13">On the other side, the implementer and the provider have the impression that they haven’t been paid enough for all they have done for the user. It is not rare for <strong>incorporation of a mediator</strong> to regulate the mutual obligations and rights between the customer and the provider, which is another component that <strong>increases costs</strong>. The client usually pays lump sum for support which is very irritating because no visible efforts are taking place, while on the other side the implementer/provider consider to be charging too little for support when providing flawless software that necessitates lot of funds. Another big problem is when the customer requires <strong>additional features and/or modifications</strong> and waits for <strong>significant duration which costs a lot of money</strong>. When any of the additional features/modules are finally functional, the circumstances and context have changed significantly, and they are of <strong>no substantial use any more</strong>.</p></span>

				<h3>SOLUTION</h3>

				<p class="text_14">In order to <strong>reduce the misunderstandings</strong> between the providers/implementers of the ERP software solutions and the clients, a <strong>decentralized system</strong> offers several improvements. The EOS operative system, its decentralisation, its dispersion as well as possibility to use smart contracts, gives remarkable opportunities to overcome the abovementioned burning issues. 
				The ERP software solution will be <strong>Open Source</strong>, which can be <strong>updated and maintained by, on one side multiple independent software teams, multiple independent implementation teams, and on the other side, the clients who are many (many-to-many, not one-to-one)</strong>. 
				In such a <strong>decentralized system</strong> for which the perfect solution is <strong>EOS</strong>, the users will be able to use various implementation teams for the same software solution, also use various teams for software production and various</p> <span id="text1"><p class="text_14">for software updates. If we create a dashboard on which the users will publish their needs as well as state how many tokens will be transferred to the implementer team, the cumulative number of tokens offered from many users with the same needs will be the incentive for the teams to uptake an assignment and fulfill it with best possible quality. That will maintain high level of motivation, quality and user service as well as mechanism for improvement of the ERP on continuous basis. <br> When a team considers the number of tokens sufficient for their work, they will be able to complete the task and obtain the tokens, on the first-come-first-served principles. This allows <strong>decentralisation and liberation of the process of acquiring, production and implementation of any software solution</strong>.  
				The teams that would work on maintenance and improvement of the software based on user needs or its implementation would have to freeze certain number of tokens and will be in position to uptake tasks that are in number maximum 20 times higher than their frozen tokens. The <strong>smart contract</strong> will allow distribution of the tokens to the team who has completed the task, if and only if it is done properly and with the expected quality. The teams who receive negative references for bad performance will not be able to uptake future tasks or assignments or will be excluded as teams from the decentralised systems. Such a framework, based on <strong>blockchain technology</strong> would allow more <strong>fair</strong> collaboration and position of both providers/implementers and users.

						  <q>Security and trust in the data and their alteration. The current software solutions have a database where any direct intervention can be done - by a developer, admin - sometimes even without management (authority) awareness. This raises problems. Even if the data is encrypted, the developers have access and knowledge of the coding schemes too. The blockchaining of data guarantees that the data is original as from day 1. But the need to make a correction is not exhausted with this. The correction needs to be blockchained too - which confirms the security and the trust. Often times, the ERP users need to have accurate information on the subsequent steps that led to certain data statuses. It can also be easily altered in the current solutions, which breaks the data integrity without traceability in the software. This disturbs the integrity and the data consistency. The blockchain implementation in these processes will mean high degree of security, integrity and trust. By using public blockchain (EOS or alike) these principles are satisfied. If using private blockchain, all of the aforementioned gets to be questionable and there is no use of these claims. In the case of decentralised, dispersed blockchain, such as EOS, we will be able to provide information security, safety, trust, integrity, confidentiality and consistency.</q>

		  	  <h5>Token utility</h5>
			  <p>The zygot token is the core resource that powers the ZERP engine. Its usage will be present in multiple mechanisms throughout the ZERP ecosystem. One modality of usage will work as follows: The users will have to stake certain amount of tokens based on the modules they want to unlock. The tokens will be locked in a smart contract for certain amount of time (e.g. 1 year). If the user decides to unlock the tokens and disable a module, he/she will be ‘penalized’ with certain amount of tokens based on the timeframe of usage. If necessary, the amount of tokens locked for the modules can be voted by the community and recalibrated accordingly. Another modality of use would be: The tokens will fuel the smart contracts that are used as a mechanism for interoperability between different instances of the engine. Examples of these are document exchange between companies, automated contracts between companies (e.g. supplier and consumer), cross-integrations between companies and access management (permissions to federated users and policies) to their databases (extranet). Third modality of use of the tokens is for the general governance throughout the system. The users can vote on variety of properties of the system (module pricing/staking, dispute mechanism, protocol changes, etc..). The tokens will also be used in the ZERP marketplace. Development teams will have to stake a certain amount of tokens in order to be eligible to accept tasks from a certain company (which also uses tokens in order to be able to request/pay a change/addition for their instance).</p>

			</div>

			<div id="distribution" class="tabcontent">
		  
			  <h5>Token distribution</h5>
			  <p>From the very beginning, Zygot’s vision was to respect certain governing principles. At first, the idea was that those principles are respected internally in the company, and then iteratively expand to the broader community. One of them is transparency. That is why we decided to follow Aragon’s transparency model. As per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project. Respecting the above principle, below is the token distribution information:<br>
				There will be a total of 300.000.000 Zygot tokens. 
				10% of the tokens are reserved for the early community supporters. Certain requirements/tasks will have to be fulfilled in order for a community member to be eligible to receive the tokens. E.g. vote for exchange listing, join telegram, test the alpha version and give feedback, reddit, etc..
				15% of the tokens will be locked in a transparent manner (smart contract) for the team and will be given in a vested form over 5 years. This decision can be altered by the majority of the token holders in case of transitioning to a DAO form.
				60% of the tokens will be sold to private funds/pools as a fundraising mechanism.
				15% of the tokens will be held in the company wallet and be used for powering partnerships, advisors, references. Those tokens will also be locked in smart contracts, and the company can only use a certain % per annum (the % can be at least 3% per annum or more (increase as voted by the community)
				</p> 

			</div>

			<div id="marketsync" class="tabcontent">
		  
			  <h5>Zygot marketsync</h5>
			  <p>Due to the current nature of the crypto ecosystem, it is not really straight forward for new users to acquire tokens. They usually need to go to unfamiliar 3rd party exchanges, verify, set up pins and additional security layers. This creates friction and makes our product onboarding more complicated, while our basic principle is fluent, optimized route. That is why, from the very beginning we will implement a mechanism that would provide a way to acquire tokens directly from our website. This would be done in a transparent way, where our backend will buy tokens on the available exchanges on behalf of the user, according current market prices, with no margin or any alteration whatsoever for acting as a kind of intermediary in the process. Since this would be a completely decentralized/open source solution, we (Zygot LTD) do not require a money transmitting license. Besides the ease of access, this would provide more liquidity of the token on the exchanges. Reports including links and audits will be provided, so everyone can monitor this process. This will by no means affect the price decided by the open market.</p>
